## IMPORTANT

-> The presented code is *not* aimed to serve as model in any way.  
-> The code was created with the sole intent of solving the problem in the quickest possible way.  
-> At the moment of creation, readibility and reusability was *not* a concern.  
-> Efficiency of algorithms was somewhat of a concern, but not a priority.  
-> All problems were done on December 2023, with the aim of doing one problem a day.  

AI was not used at all. Internet was only occasionnaly used to search for documentation.  
The use of external libraries (outside of those essentially adding coding confort) was 
limited as much as possible.

It is possible that I come back to my code later to make it more readable and/or optimized.
